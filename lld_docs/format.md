The format of an LLD (Low-Level Design) document can vary depending on your team‚Äôs workflow and preferences, but here's a solid and practical structure that's widely appreciated:

### üóÇÔ∏è Suggested Format for an LLD Document

1. **Title and Overview**

   - Name of the component/module
   - Brief purpose or context

2. **Assumptions**

   - Any known constraints, dependencies, or preconditions

3. **Functional Requirements**

   - Clear bullet points outlining what the component needs to do

4. **Architecture & Design**

   - Class diagrams, flowcharts, sequence diagrams, or component diagrams
   - Libraries or frameworks used

5. **Class/Component Details**

   - Class names, responsibilities
   - Method signatures and purpose
   - Data members (brief explanation)

6. **Data Flow & Interaction**

   - How data moves between components
   - APIs involved, if any

7. **Error Handling & Edge Cases**

   - What happens when things go wrong

8. **Security Considerations**

   - Authentication, authorization, validation, etc.

9. **Scalability & Performance Notes**

   - Design choices to improve performance or scalability

10. **Open Questions or TODOs**

    - Areas still under discussion or for future improvement

11. **Appendix**
    - References to HLD documents, external APIs, mockups, etc.

### üîß Format Options

- **Markdown or Confluence**: Great for collaboration and readability
- **Word/PDF Document**: More formal, useful for offline reviews or documentation archives
- **Google Docs**: Perfect for version-controlled, team-editable designs

It‚Äôs less about the tool and more about clarity, structure, and making life easier for the next person reading it. Would you like me to help you start one in Markdown? I can sketch a quick outline if you tell me the component you're working on! üöÄüìÑ‚ú®
